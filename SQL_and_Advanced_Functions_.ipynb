        "- SQL commands are categorized into several types based on their purpose. The three key categories are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - DDL (Data Definition Language): Defines or modifies database structure such as tables, schemas, or indexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Common commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
        "     StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "     StudentName VARCHAR(100)\n",
        "     );\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  - DML (Data Manipulation Language): Manages data within tables. Used to insert, update, or delete data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Common commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, StudentName)\n",
        "VALUES (1, 'John Doe');\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "- OFFSET specifies the number of records to skip before starting to return rows.\n",

        "- A CTE (Common Table Expression) is a temporary, named result set defined within a SQL query using the WITH clause.\n",

        "\n",
        " 1. NF (First Normal Form):\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Each cell contains only atomic (single) values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - No repeating groups or arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Example: Splitting phone numbers into separate rows.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. NF (Second Normal Form):\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Must satisfy 1NF.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Example: Remove partial dependencies in composite keys.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. NF (Third Normal Form):\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Must satisfy 2NF.\n",

        "  - No transitive dependency (non-key attributes should not depend on another non-key attribute).\n",
